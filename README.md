# Surprise-Index
## Mathematica code files and R graphing code files for Surprise Index research project

This repository contains Mathematic code files for calculating the Surprise Index of various univariate discrete distributions. Files which are also included in this repository are Mathematica calculations of these surprise indices with various parameters and values and R code for graphing a few of the surprise indices. This is the work I completed for my master's project at UNCW.

The research paper I prepared with Dr. Indranil Ghosh was published and may be found at https://www.mdpi.com/2400974 it is titled, "On Surprise Indices Related to Univariate Discrete and Continuous Distributions: A Survey."
